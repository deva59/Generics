BOUNDED GENERIC TYPE

In general, the type parameter can accept any data type
(except primitive types).Howeve, if we want to use generics
for some specific types(such as accept data of number types)
only,then we can use bounded types.
In this casr of bound types,we use the extends keyword.
Here, GenericsClass is created with bounded type, this Means Generics
Class can only work with data types that are children of number(Integer,Double,
and so on).

class GenericsClass<T extends Number>{

public void display(){
System.out.printn("This is bounded type generics class.");
}
